Hi, I'm Jada!

I have been working as a bartender in the service industry for several years and through the pandemic became interested in Data Analytics. 
Though I love bartending and hate the thought of leaving, I feel a pull toward data and an instictual urge to challenge myself in my growth as a professional.
Today, I bartend at a local craft brewery where I also spend a lot of my time managing and creating content for our social media accounts. 
On my days off, I dive into various paths and resources for learning data anaytics such as Linkedin Learning, Khan Academy and Datacamp.
I have always been data driven and am excited to be abe to showcase what I have learned and the projects I have worked on throughout my journey.
